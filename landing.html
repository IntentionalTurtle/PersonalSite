            <p class="pastinfo info">I grew up in a larger sized suburb of Charlotte, NC called Gastonia. I was an exceptional student
            in terms of grades and understanding of material and graduation valedictorian at my high school.
            I then attended UNC Chapel Hill where I recieved a BS in Biology after four years and decided that 
            I wanted to be a teacher. I went back to my hometown and was lucky enough to get offered a job and
            to teach at my high school alma mater. I was licensed as a general science expert meaning I could 
            and did teach any and all science courses during my time. In eight years of teaching I have taught:

                <p class="nowinfo info">Right before COVID, I had just gotten certified as an EMT in order to 
                    have another job between teaching. During COVID, I made the call to not practice EMT 
                    medicine as I had just begun a serious relationship and would be forced to end it for 
                    quarentine reasons due to the pandemic. I ended up marrying my then girlfriend in 2021
                    and we had our first child in 2022. I decided to begin to learn coding with the goal of 
                    being able to break out of an increasingly bad teaching situation post-COVID that did 
                    not fit the needs of my family.
